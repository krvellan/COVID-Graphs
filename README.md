# COVID-Graphs

Obejective:
<p>Through this project I wanted to see if the data about COVID-19 can provide insights about the virus in 2020. Specifically I wanted to see how the COVID rates are in 2021 compared to the previous years. Specifically I want to see if the case count is getting higher, compared to the previous years and compared to previous months within 2021.</p>

Why Jupyter Notebooks?
<p>I utilized Jupyter Notebook to load the data and conduct my analysis so that it is easier to share my visiuals and code with others. By using a Jupyter Notebook I eliminated the need for the user (you) from downloaidng the code and running it yourself. This allows for easier sharing of the work, and results for reasons previously mentioned.</p>

Data
<p>The data has been pulled from the WHO website, which the link can be found for in the Jupyter Notebook. The data has been pulled directly using a link, elminating the need to download the data and host it in the directory. Looking at the Jupyter Notebook you will be able to see vearious different data analysis on the data.</p>

Conclusion
<p>Based on the data analysis conducted it is safe to say that the count of cases has not reached to as bad as a point as it did in the previous years. One thing to keep in mind though is that the graph is showing that the cases are growing, which means if the CDC guidlines are not followed there is potential for us to get in a situation like previous years. It is also important to note that the dip in cases happened once the vaccines have been rolled out.</p>
